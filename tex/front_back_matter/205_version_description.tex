This file contains everything I know in math and some more by other contributors (mainely in the French part for the moment).

Subdivided in two main parts
\begin{itemize}
    \item Le Frido in French contains the mathematics for the first few years in mathematics: from the construction of the rationals to the Markov chains trough Lebesgue measure, representation theory and fields extensions.
    \item Giulietta in English contains whatever mathematics at higher level.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
    Every contributions are most welcome.
